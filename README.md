# ReactJourney
A journey into learning React.js, doing mostly small projects  

## Preface
This repo is part of my project to learn React.js as bigger plan to become an Ethereum Developer. Feel free to copy my projects idea(I mostly copied them myself) and suggest more.

Disclaimer: Before beginning this I already had experience in programming, but very few on web development in general.

## Project #1 - HACKERish NEWS (WIP)
It's just like hacker news, but even uglier.

The main objective of this is to get my hands dirty in structuring a project and creating components, so I won't do a lot of state management here. To build a good habit, I would also like to write some tests for this.

## Project 2 - Faketube

Another unsatisfactory clone, this time it's youtube. I just wanted to do that because it's been a while since I don't play with React that I felt that I needed to relearn everything. Which was what I did with this project.
